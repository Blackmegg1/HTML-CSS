# CSS 

While i learning CSS online, i decide to realize all knowledge points by a HTML. But it's a little hard   

to me , so i write down all the knowledge points about each module in case i forgot them when i coding HTML.   

## Box model

1. intrinsic sizing & extrinsic sizing.
2. box-model includes content-box, padding-box, border-box, margin-box, a useful analogy is artwork.
3. the differences between content-box and border-box.
